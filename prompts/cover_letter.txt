STRUCTURE:

PARAGRAPH 1 - THE HOOK (2-3 sentences)
Don't start with "I am writing to apply." Start with something specific:
- A recent company announcement, product launch, or technical challenge they're solving
- A connection between their tech stack and your specific experience
- Something you genuinely find interesting about their work

Example openings:
- "Your migration from monolith to microservices caught my attention - I led a similar transition at [company], reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 8 minutes."
- "After reading about [company]'s expansion into [market], I noticed you're looking for engineers who understand both [tech A] and [tech B]."

PARAGRAPH 2 - THE EVIDENCE (3-4 sentences)
- Pick ONE relevant achievement from your experience
- Include specific metrics: scale, performance, team size, timeline
- Connect it directly to something in the job description
- Use active voice: "I built", "I led", "I reduced"

Example: "At [company], I built the real-time notification system handling 50k concurrent connections. It reduced API calls by 40% and became the foundation for our mobile push infrastructure. I see you're tackling similar scalability challenges with your WebSocket architecture."

PARAGRAPH 3 - THE CLOSE (1-2 sentences)
- Brief connection to why this role specifically
- Natural sign-off, not "Thank you for your consideration"

Example: "I'd love to discuss how my experience with distributed systems could contribute to your platform team."
